# MAC-TITOU-MACOS
The configuration files for my personal Hackintosh.

# Hardware
* ASUS ROG STRIX Z390-E Gaming
* Intel Core i7-9700K
* Corsair 64Gb DDR4-2666 Quad-Kit
* Samsung V-NAND SSD 970 PRO NVMe M.2 512Gb
* Western Digital WD Black Desktop 4Tb
* Sapphire RADEON RX 5700 XT NITRO+
* Seasonic Prime PX-750 SnowSilent 80+ Titanium
* Fractal Design Define 7 Solid White

# Software
* [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) 0.5.8
  * The [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) has almost everything.
    * Did not use [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen): was causing a kernel panic during install.
    * Used [USBInjectAll](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-usb-inject-all) to be able to use keyboard and mouse during install.
  * It was nice to watch a clean install using the same motherboard: [ASUS Z390 E GAMING with Intel i9-9900K Opencore 0.5.7 Hackintosh & Benchmarks!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlV4FC-5Uu8).
